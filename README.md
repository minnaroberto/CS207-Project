# Arduino Maze with Magnet Sensors

This project is an Arduino maze made out of cardboard. 
The main objective of the maze game is to roll a marble onto three different door-like flaps of the maze which have magets attached to them.
When a player successfully closes this flap a magnet sensor will sense the magnet attached to the flap. It will also turn on an LED to signal the successful close.

## Build

1. Design the dimensions for the cardboard pices as shown below.

![final maze game build](images/dimensions.jpg)

Also make rectangular pieces that will be the walls inside the maze.
The 27cm x 27cm piece will be the base of the maze. 
The four 27cm x 2cm pieces will be the outer walls of the maze
The four 29cm x 4cm pieces will be the square that control the x-axis
The two large pieces with a base width of 24cm will be the left and right walls to hold up the maze.


2. Plan out the areas where you want the magnetic sensors and magnets to go. 


Cut three lines so that the cardboard can lift up.

3. Begin hot gluing the pieces together. 

4. Cut out a square large enough to fit a servo motor in the left wall and the top edge of the x-axis square. Then hot glue the servos into place.

5. Hot glue the motors spinners. One onto the left edge of the x-axis square, and the other on the top edge of the outer wall of the maze.

6. Wire the magnet sensors

7. Hot glue the magnet sensors and magnets into their respective places. 

8. Attach the x-axis square and maze so that the walls are holding them up.

9. Follow the schematic to set up the hardware.
