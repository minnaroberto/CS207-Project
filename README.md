# Arduino Maze with Magnet Sensors

This project is an Arduino maze made out of cardboard. 
The main objective of the maze game is to roll a marble onto three different door-like flaps of the maze which have magets attached to them.
When a player successfully closes this flap a magnet sensor will sense the magnet attached to the flap. It will also turn on an LED to signal the successful close.
